# Heart-disease-Project

This is a machine learning based heart disease prediction project.
Here we were given a set of problems with various attributes and data, we then figured out a dataset from kaggle, visualized it, prprocessed it, gave traoning and testing inputs and outputs, splitted the dataa into training and testing data sets, took an algoritm, in this case, decision tree classifier and tested the data while plotting it using dictionories like matplotlib, plotly, cufflinks, seaburn, etc. and finallly compared our predictions with actual results.
